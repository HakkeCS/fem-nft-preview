## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML
- Vanilla CSS

### What I learned

This project really helped me understand and organize flex objects. I imagine that this is far from best practice, so I will work on that in the future. I think one of the biggest takeaways from this project was how to place a transparent overlay with an icon on an image. 

### Continued development
 
I absolutely need to work on organizing CSS style sheets and getting a better grasp on responsive layouts.

I also struggle with flex containers and items but I'm slowly getting more confortable with those.
